## Design Philosophy

Every accessibility constraint is an opportunity to create better design:

- **Visual Hierarchy** - Semantic HTML creates natural information architecture
- **Cognitive Load** - Accessible patterns reduce mental strain
- **Affordance** - Proper labels and structure make interfaces more intuitive
- **Vertical Rhythm** - Relative units create scalable, harmonious layouts
